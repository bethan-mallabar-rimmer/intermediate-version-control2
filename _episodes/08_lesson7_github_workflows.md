### Summary

We have seen how to work with remote repositories, and how download and upload changes.

In the next remainder of this session we will look at typical workflows using GitHub.
We'll also see how we can rewrite our history, as well as the tools we have available to get unstuck when applying these more complicated changes.

### Exercise

We will go through an example of creating our own fork of a public repository, cloning our own version of it, then adding an upstream remote to the original repository.
